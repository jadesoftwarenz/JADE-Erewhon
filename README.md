2. Select the **Source Management** sheet.
3. Enter your name and email address in the **Commit Details** group box inside the **Source Control** group box.

5. Click the **OK** button.

**Step 2: Cloning the Repository**

1. In the Browse menu, select the **Clone** command from the Git Source Control Client submenu.
(The local path is filled in for you as the path you selected in Step 1.)
2. For the Repository URL, enter https://github.com/jadesoftwarenz/JADE-Erewhon.
3. Click the **Clone** button.

**Step 3: Importing the Erewhon Database**

2. Check the **Load Multiple Schemas** check box.
3. Select the **ErewhonInvestments.mul** file in the folder you selected as your working directory.
4. Click the **OK** button, and the Erewhon schemas will be loaded into your Schema Browser ready for use.

**Optional Step: Using the DotNet Shop**
1. Load the Erewhon schemas.
2. Load the initial data using the **initializeData** JadeScript method in ErewhonInvestmentsModelSchema.
3. From the ErewhonInvestmentsViewSchema, select **Exposures** from the Browse menu and double-click on **DotNetExposure** on the **C#** sheet.
4. Click through until you get to the **Generate** sheet. On this sheet, check the **Generate Sample .csproj File** and **Generate Sample .config File** check boxes. For the Output Directory, set **\<Your-Local-Repository-Directory\>\Erewhon\ErewhonDotNetExposure\\**, creating the ErewhonDotNetExposure folder, if necessary.
5. Open the generated **DotNetExposure.csproj** in Visual Studio.
6. Right-click **DotNetExposure**, select Build, Platform target: to **x64**.
7. Build the project.
8. Exit from Visual Studio. (You donâ€™t need to save the solution.)
9. Navigate to the **ErewhonDotNetShop** folder in your local repository directory.
	
	(You can skip the next two steps if you have installed JADE in **C:\Jade**.)
10. Open **app.config** in your preferred text editor (for example, Notepad++), and change all instances of **C:\Jade** to your JADE install directory.
11. If you have renamed your system folder or if your **jade.ini** file is not located in the JADE base directory, modify the file paths, as needed.
12. Open **ErewhonDotNetShop.csproj** in your preferred text editor (for example, Notepad++), and change all instances of **C:\Jade** to your JADE install directory.
13. Make sure you have a JADE database on a server node (that is, jadrap) running for your JADE database, then open **ErewhonDotNetShop.sln** in Microsoft Visual Studio, build, and run it.
